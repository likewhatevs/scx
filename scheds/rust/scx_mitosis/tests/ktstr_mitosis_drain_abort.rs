#![cfg(feature = "ktstr-tests")]
//! Reproducer: scx_mitosis aborts when a freed mid-range cell leaves a sparse
//! cell-id range its per-LLC drain cannot relocate. On this branch (the
//! one-shot orphan-DSQ drain) the test FAILs — that failure is the bug; a
//! build whose drain handles the empty cell (a deferred / empty-cell-aware
//! drain) PASSes.
//!
//! ## Mechanism
//!
//! In LLC-aware mode each cell has one DSQ per LLC. When a cell loses all
//! CPUs in an LLC, `recalc_cell_llc_counts` drains that orphaned DSQ by
//! moving its tasks to another LLC the cell still owns. The destination
//! search picks the first LLC with a surviving CPU; if the cell owns NO
//! LLC with CPUs, the search yields none. The buggy version then calls
//! `scx_bpf_error("cell N has no CPUs in any LLC; cannot drain")`, which
//! aborts the whole scheduler. A fixed version does not abort on the empty
//! cell (it skips or defers that drain).
//!
//! This is reached deterministically via a sparse cell-id range. With
//! `--cell-parent-cgroup /mitosis`, mitosis allocates a cell id to every
//! cgroup created under `/mitosis` (in inotify event order). When a
//! mid-range cell is freed, mitosis zeroes that config slot (empty
//! cpumask) but the slot's previous `cpu_cnt` was `> 0`, so the next
//! `apply_cell_config` processes a `>0 -> 0` transition for a cell that
//! now owns no LLC — the drain's destination search returns invalid and
//! the abort fires on that apply (within about one monitor interval of the
//! middle cgroup being freed).
//!
//! ## What this test does
//!
//! A churner thread repeatedly creates a trio of ephemeral cgroups under
//! the cell-parent, lets mitosis allocate them cell ids, then removes the
//! MIDDLE one. The freed cell sits between the trio's first and last cells
//! in cell-id space, so its zeroed config slot is a sparse middle still
//! covered by a higher surviving cell (the trio's last) — exactly the
//! configuration that drives the drain into the empty-cell abort. The gap
//! is intrinsic to freeing the middle of the trio and does not depend on
//! any other cell's id. `cg_a` carries a steady workload so the scheduler
//! is active. The ephemerals are kept task-free: a task in the freed cell
//! would make even the fixed scheduler abort (its next enqueue hits
//! `pick_llc_for_task` on a cell with no LLC), muddying the discriminator.
//!
//! ## Verdict
//!
//! A `post_vm_unconditional` callback (runs even on the guest-fail/crash path)
//! matches the scheduler's `scx_bpf_error` reason in `result.stderr`. With
//! `loglevel=7` (scheduler kargs) the guest kernel routes that printk to COM1,
//! which the harness captures as `result.stderr`. The buggy scheduler aborts
//! with "no CPUs in any LLC; cannot drain" → the callback fails the test with
//! that attribution (RED). The fixed scheduler runs the whole duration without
//! it → GREEN. A crash with a DIFFERENT reason is still a guest-fail (RED) but
//! is not mis-attributed to this bug.
//!
//! This test lives on the branch with the buggy one-shot drain: built from
//! this tree it FAILs with the cannot-drain abort — that failure IS the bug.
//! Point `KTSTR_SCHEDULER` at a build whose drain handles the empty cell (a
//! deferred / empty-cell-aware drain) and it PASSes, confirming the fix.
//!
//! ## Running
//!
//! Gated behind the `ktstr-tests` cargo feature (the regular build does not
//! pull in the ktstr VM test harness). scx_mitosis is built from this tree:
//!
//! ```text
//! # run from the scx_mitosis package dir so `--features` resolves:
//! cargo ktstr test --kernel <linux> --features ktstr-tests \
//!   -E 'test(mitosis_cell_id_gap_drain_abort)'
//! ```
//!
//! Point `KTSTR_SCHEDULER` at an external scx_mitosis binary to check a
//! specific build instead of the one built from this tree.
